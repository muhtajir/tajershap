![Banner](/banner.png)

This repository contains the content and configuration for [my personal blog](https://blog.samrhea.com).

## 🏗️ Hugo

The blog is a Hugo static site. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is an open-source static site generator.

## ✨ Cloudflare Workers Sites

[Workers Sites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites/) serves the blog. The post [here](https://blog.samrhea.com/post/wrangler-sites/) walks through that setup in detail.

## 🤠 wrangler

The `wrangler` CLI tool publishes the blog. You can learn more about `wrangler` [here](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler). The post [here](https://blog.samrhea.com/post/deploy-pipeline/) breaks down how I deploy the blog.

## 🌵 Hugo Cactus Theme

The site uses the [Cactus theme](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-cactus-theme), a theme built by [digitalcraftsman](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman) that is based on the [port](https://github.com/nickbalestra/kactus) of Jekyll's Cactus theme by [Nick Balestra](https://github.com/nickbalestra).
